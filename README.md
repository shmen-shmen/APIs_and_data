# APIs_and_data

Just a small app that gets ISS coordinates from wheretheiss.at and renders them onto a map. 
Coordinates update once a second so you can follow the flight semi real time.

This is a project from The Coding Train's "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript" course,
I just post it here because I find looking at it comfortig in a weird way.

*** The icon of ISS was exchanged for Russian Te**orist Vladlen Tatarski because he got 
killed while I was doing the project. May his sins be forgiven, Glory to Ukraine.
